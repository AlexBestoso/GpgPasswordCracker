# GpgPasswordCracker
I wrote this script to help me recover a password that I forgot. Hope you find it useful.
<br><br>
This script requires : `gpg` `head` `sed`
<br><br>
This script was written to use the keys that I already had stored in my environment, so it currently runs gpg with sudo.<br>
This line of code can have sudo removed, or can be modified to take a key input directly.
